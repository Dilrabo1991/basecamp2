# Task
I had a hard time learning rails at first, but now I'm pretty good at it!
I'm mainly having trouble working on the attachment but now easy for me!

# Description
I worked hard to solve the problems!
Mainly google and youtube helped me 
but there are very few rails related
resources on youtube which made it difficult for me to learn rails!

# Installation
 
 ```shell
bundle install
```
 ```shell
 rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

 ```shell
 rails s
```
